Welcome to **PostTechBot**! This is a Python script designed to automate interactions on the [Post.tech](https://post.tech/) platform using Selenium and the ChatGPT API for generating tweets and replies. If you find this script useful, please consider giving it a star.

## Features

- **Automated Tweeting**: PostTechBot can create and send tweets on your behalf using the ChatGPT API.

- **Automated Replies**: It can also automatically reply to messages on the Post.tech platform using the ChatGPT API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PostTechBot.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```shell
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment (skip this step if you didn't create a virtual environment):

   - On Windows:

     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project directory with the following content:

   ```env
   username=user1
   password=pass
   gpt=apikey
   ```

   Replace `user1`, `pass`, and `apikey` with your actual Post.tech username, password, and ChatGPT API key.

6. Install the required Firefox WebDriver:

   - Download the latest GeckoDriver from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
   - Add the GeckoDriver executable to your system's PATH.

7. Configure your ChatGPT API credentials:

   - Obtain your API key from the OpenAI platform.

   - Set your API key as an environment variable:

     ```shell
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

8. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python posttechbot.py
   ```

   This will start the automation process.

## Configuration

- You can customize the tweet and reply messages by modifying the `tweet_message` and `reply_message` variables in the script.
